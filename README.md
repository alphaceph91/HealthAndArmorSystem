# HealthAndArmorSystem
 Unreal Engine 5

A very simple health and armor system in Unreal Engine 5 similar to games like Doom Eternal and the new Wolfenstein series where the player character's armor gets depleted first and then the health gets depleted. The project is using first person template but the logic could be applied to third person games.
